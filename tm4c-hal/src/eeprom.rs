//! Code for the EEProm module.
//!
//! Tested on a TM4C123 Tiva C Series Launchpad
//!
//! Note: This code manually increments the EEBLOCK and EEOFFSET registers
//! after each read and write instead of using the EERDWRINC register. The
//! debugger was giving inconsistent register results for the EEOFFSET register
//! after using EERDWRINC. Also, the EERDWRINC does not increment the block in
//! the case of a wrap of the offset, so it seems less useful for data that
//! spans blocks.
//!
//! This flexibility comes at the cost of efficiency, as the
//! datasheet calls for at least 4 cycles of delay after setting the EEBLOCK
//! register.
