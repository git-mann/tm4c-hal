# MSP432E401Y is functionally equivalent to TM4C1294NCPDT as used in Tiva C Connected Launchpad.
# The only difference is MSP432 has SimpleLink functions in ROM
# and TM4C has TivaWare functions in ROM.
# As long as tm4c129x-hal never uses ROM functions these chips are, as far as I know, 100% compatible.
# They certainly have the same memory map, appear to have the same periperals and share the same errata list.
